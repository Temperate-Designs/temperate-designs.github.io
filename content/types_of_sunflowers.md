There are more types of flowers like
- Bell flower cannons are basically bell flowers. If you jump on one, it will slingshot you. You can't controll how far it slingshots you,
  and you can't controll where you go either. They slingshot you in the opposite direction the flower is from the stem (if it's on the left,
  it will slingshot you forwards, if it's on the right, it will slingshot you backwards.
- Weeds will hide stuff on the ground, and there's usually a small gap where they are; they take over from the sunflowers.
- Dandelions will scatter seeds that you can ride on. You can not controll where you go, and dissapear, leaving the seed. You can grab the
  seed to plant another dandelion (ex. if you need to cross a patch of weeds)
