Flowers

- Sunflowers are the main flower that you will see throughout the game.
- Some sunflowers will be wilted and collapse 1 second after contact with the ball.
- Bellflowers catapult you forward into the air and you will fly for 5 seconds.
- Swaying sunflowers sway in the wind and you have to calculate when to jump on them.
- Dandelions let off dandelion seeds that carry you through the air.
