- Bottles are a quick way to get underground.
- Sleeping gophers chase you when you walk into the tunnel. If you have a snail shell you can disguise and walk right past the sleeping gophers.
- Gophers chase you until you get out of the tunnel.
- Worms make small tunnels that you can escape from the gophers.
- Worms will pop you if you get too close to them.
